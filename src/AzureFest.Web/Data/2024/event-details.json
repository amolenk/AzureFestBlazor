Your team should strive to achieve the \u00227Cs\u0022 whenever feasible. The DevOps mindset has been applied to other fields, resulting in DevSecOps, DataOps, AIOps, and MLOps, collectively known as XOps.\r\n\r\nSo, the theory is sound. But to actually accomplish this in practice, with an actual application, is another challenge altogether. Based on a real DevOps implementation journey, I will share how I implemented the \u0022C\u0022 of the 7Cs that is often lacking even in mature DevOps cycles: Continuous Monitoring. I will also disclose where I went wrong and how to further improve upon what I delivered in the end.\r\n\r\nWhat can you expect? As you are probably aware, Azure has plenty of services that can help us set up and professionalize the monitoring process. As an obedient DevOps disciple, I started with a containerized application using Azure Container Apps. I will show how to gather data using Azure Monitor and Azure Sentinel, set effective alerts based on pre-determined, smart triggers to turn that data into actionable information, and use Action Groups and Functions to create and update items on an Azure DevOps board (or other ALM tooling). Adding more customization using KQL for custom queries of the telemetry and creating dashboards in Azure DevOps that connect back to all that monitoring using Power BI will also be on the program. And finally, the cherry on top: integrating with Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams to fully automate the jump from monitoring and operations to planning.\r\n\r\nAfter this session, you will have plenty of inspiration and examples of using monitoring, analytics, and telemetry to build higher-quality and more secure cloud applications. If you want to ensure you can keep building quality software, make sure you join me and learn how to automate as much of the monitoring process as possible!\r\n",

      "Description": "Azure\u0027s web-based access is incredibly convenient, allowing you to enter the portal from any device, anywhere. But this convenience isn\u0027t exclusive to you; it\u0027s also a potential gateway for those with malicious intent, trying to exploit your resources, data and budget. The consequences from a security breach can be huge.\r\n\r\nIn an era where digital protection is needed more than ever, navigating the security tools can be overwhelming. Some tools might slow down your processes. Is the added security worth the potential decrease in speed? Is it necessary?\r\n\r\nThis session is your guide through the security options available to cloud engineers. We\u0027ll explore MFA, PIM, JIT, VPN, PAW, and other three-letter abbreviations that stand between your Azure environment intruders. Discover modern tools that not only secure your Azure space but could also be used for on-premises access through Azure.\r\n\r\nBy the end of our journey, you\u0027ll have a blueprint for creating the most secure environment. You\u0027ll leave equipped to make informed decisions about which security measures are right for your setup. Let\u0027s secure your Azure landscape together.",
